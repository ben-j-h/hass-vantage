* DMX lights not reading RGB values right
* DMX lights not setting to color_temp right
* Fix capitalizations of hass-make-groups.pl


* extra variables and tasks from vantage config

* support set_variable (by name) service

* support call_task, call_task_vid services; can I expose buttons for calling the tasks in the UI?

* make circadiant work for the Ketra lights, too.

* test DMX on the ketra lights via vantage directly instead of using driver; get DMX hub working
